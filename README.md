# Context
This project was created for the course of "Elements of Computational Intelligence" and consists of a bot for the card game called "Cheater". My job was to implement a strategy for a player that had to be written in Python and based on the example one which was given. At first my player was tested in the game with, unknown for me, lecturer’s players and then it took part in the competition within my laboratory group in which I got the highest possible score as my player has beaten all players provided by both lecturer and my colleagues.
# Rules
This project is based on the card game called "Cheater ". Game is played with one deck of cards from 9 to 14 (ace) – each with 4 color variants (24 cards in total). Cards are dealt randomly to two players – 8 cards for each player. The goal is to get rid of all your cards. Players take their turns alternately. A turn consists of placing on the common pile one card face-down declaring which card you placed (so you may lie). Declared card must have at least the same value as the previously declared card on the top of the common pile. Next the other player may or may not check if you lied. If you get caught lying  you have to take 3 cards from the top of the heap, if not – the player who was checking takes 3 cards.
